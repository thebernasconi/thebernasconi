## Hi, Marco here ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Project Manager that is mutating into a Developer.

- I'm 5% done with my Graduate Degree in Software Engineering
- I'm 40% done with my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science.
- I'm 100% done with my Bachelor Degree in International Relations.

## What I'm doing and where I'm going

I'm currently focusing on developing my skills as a FullStack Dev and I'm very much interested in the Cybersecurty Industry, where I currently work as a P.M.
That said, I've been scouting oportunities for internships and entry level jobs as a proper dev so I can fully focus on it all.
